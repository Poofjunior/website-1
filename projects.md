## Sensorimotor Games
In tasks involving adaptive algorithms and continuously-learning humans, 
rich dynamic behaviors can prevent the system from reaching consensus. 
We investigate these fundamental phenomena from the framework of
continuous games, in which `players' in this game each have their own preferences
that may be misaligned with one another, through different task definitions 
or limited communication or trust.
