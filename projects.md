## Sensorimotor Games
In tasks involving adaptive algorithms and continuously-learning humans, 
rich dynamic behaviors can prevent the system from reaching consensus. 
We investigate these fundamental phenomena from the framework of
continuous games: players each have their own preferences
that may be misaligned due to through different task definitions 
or limited communication.
